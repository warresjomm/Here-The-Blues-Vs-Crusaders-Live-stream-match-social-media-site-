Between the Blues Vs Crusaders in Super Rugby Pacific 2025, they have proven that the two can make for the grittiest, most historic tournament thus far. Through the last game both teams proved their strengths and desire to fight.
New information on a recent matchup:
Crusaders Blues lost 4/22, 25, live, Eden Park; 3028 is the correct answer as the Crusaders were offensively successful. The match saw six compounded by Chays Fihaki, Kyle Preston and Sevu Reece with Taha Kemara converting the majority. Due to the managery of Dalton Papali'i and Finlay Christie, the Blues were able to get over for at least a couple of tries. The Crusaders were able to hide as efforts because they had a better strategy. The Crusaders won the game, scoring more runs, more meters, more clean breaks, more defenders beaten, and more stops than the Blues. In other words, they won.
The Crusaders beat the Blues 42–19 at Eden Park on 1 April 2025. It was a match littered with attempts, a strong set piece effort and kicking executed with a great deal of nous. In the opening minutes of the game, Kyle Preston, Sevu Reece and Tom Christie each made huge plays that helped the Crusaders take the lead. The Crusaders proved too aggressive for a gallant Blues effort. The Crusaders were the side who dominated throughout the entire fixture, after all.
The team went on to defeat the Blues 41–19 after visiting Eden Park on March 19, 2025. Even with both teams crossing the try line when the two sides met, the Crusaders were more technical in their finishing and played a defense that was high risk averse. Fihaki, Williams, and Havili controlled the constant flow of attack making them difficult for the Blues to keep up with. The Blues started the game strong, but they failed to hold the lead.
The historical settler and the rival:
The Blues and Crusaders have met within the 42-year history of Super Rugby. The two teams have met 45 times since 1996; the Blues have won 12 and the Crusaders have won 32 matches while one match was drawn. The Crusaders's achievement this time around is nothing short of extraordinary, particularly in their last 18 matches, having won 17 of them.
The rivalry has always been marked by fierce showdowns, classic playoff battles and an undercurrent of "bad blood" that has been laced with a string of mutual respect throughout its history. It is worth noting that the Crusaders defeated the Blues in the final of the Super Rugby competition in Eden Park in 2022, to win their eleventh championship. For the first time in forever, the Blues were able to stop their long winning streak.
Beauden Barrett and Richie Mo'unga tangle in the dueling battles where the head-to-head matchups have an outsized footprint on the outcome of those matches. These competitors are looking to control the meetings happening.
Team Performance and Stats (for 2025):
In the last few games, Crusaders not only accumulated more runs than its predecessors (1048 against 982), but they also made more clean breaks (66 against 41), as well as more tackles and defeats of defenders (215 against 162).
The coaching staff, head by Rob Penney, has done a tremendous job at keeping their side firing and disciplined on a week-to-week basis as they pursue the ultimate prize.
To summarize:
This is proved due to the fact that they have not only beaten the Blues in matches past, but they have won their recent from the past encounters with relative ease. Super Rugby Pacific is a pressure cooker championship and as such the games have been physically tough, strategically complex and emotionally draining. Certainly, the Crusaders have beaten them up over the years and also more recently, yet still the Blues remain a tough and dangerous foe who could always challenge that status quo
